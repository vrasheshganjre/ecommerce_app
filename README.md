# E-commerce app with flutter

## Overview

Welcome to our E-Commerce App. Built with Flutter, our app embodies the principles of clean architecture, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user interface coupled with robust functionality.

Powered Flutter Bloc for efficient state management, Supabase for secure and scalable backend infrastructure, GetIt for streamlined dependency injection, fpdart for functional programming paradigms, and cached_network_image for lightning-fast image loading, our app delivers a sophisticated platform for modern consumers.

Immerse yourself in a world of curated collections, discover unique products, all within a beautifully crafted interface that seamlessly adapts to your preferences with both light and dark themes.

There is work to be done in theming of the application to make it more user pleasing and interactive.
